	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: purple; font-weight: bold;">	
		In the enchanted valley of Aaryadhan stood the prestigious "Sumeru School of Magics," a heaven for aspiring magicians.
		Among them was a boy named Maanav, whose journey had once been the epitome of brilliance.
		At the age of nine, he had astonished everyone, earning the title of "The Youngest Sorcerer" in the school's history.
		His spells were mesmerizing, his wand movements flawless, and his aura radiated promise.
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: red; font-weight: bold;">
		However, fate took a cruel turn the following year.
		His magical prowess began to dwindle inexplicably.
		Simple spells, once executed with ease, became insurmountable.
		Teachers whispered about his "fall from grace," and his classmates ridiculed him relentlessly.
		From being a prodigy, Maanav was reduced to "the dullest magician" in the school.
		His once-bright eyes now reflected despair, and his days were filled with mockery and solitude.
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: navy; font-weight: bold;">
		One overcast evening,
		as he sat by the shimmering Lake of Reflections—his favorite spot for finding solace—he noticed a cloaked figure approaching.
		The figure exuded an enigmatic aura, and as it came closer, Maanav's heart began to race.
		The man's eyes were unlike anything he had seen before—deep, wise, and brimming with untold stories.
		Without a second thought, Maanav stood up, tears streaming down his face, and ran toward the man.
		He fell to his knees, touching the stranger's feet with reverence.
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: transparent; font-weight: bold;">
		<u style="color: gray;">
			<mark>
				"You... you are Him!" Maanav stammered, his voice trembling with awe.
			</mark>
		</u>
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: green; font-weight: bold;">
		The man placed a gentle hand on Maanav's shoulder, lifting him.
		"Who I am does not matter, child. What matters is who you are and who you can become."
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: coral; font-weight: bold;">
		Maanav felt a spark reignite within him.
		"Everyone says I’m useless now... that I’m no more than a shadow of my former self," he said, his voice breaking.
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #802658; font-weight: bold;">
		The man chuckled softly.
		"Magic, my boy, is not merely in spells and wands.
		It lies in belief, in understanding the soul of the craft. Tell me, when did you last believe in yourself?"
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #254117; font-weight: bold;">
		Maanav's silence was answer enough.
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #151B54; font-weight: bold;">
		The man handed him a peculiar-looking orb.
		"This holds the truth of your magic. But to unlock it,
		you must embark on a journey—one that will challenge your will, your courage, and your heart."
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #FFA729; font-weight: bold;">
		Intrigued yet uncertain, Maanav hesitated. "What must I do?"
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #1379FF; font-weight: bold;">
		The man smiled. "Trust yourself. Face what lies ahead.
		And never forget—true power comes not from strength but from understanding."
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #805160; font-weight: bold;">
		With that, the mysterious figure vanished into thin air,
		leaving Maanav clutching the orb, a flicker of hope rekindling in his heart.
		Little did he know, this was the beginning of a transformation that would shake the foundations of the magical world.
		But the answers he sought were as mysterious as the man he had just met.
		Who was he? And what secrets did the orb hold?
		The path ahead shimmered with both promise and peril, and Maanav realized that to regain his lost glory,
		he would have to unravel not only the mysteries of magic but also the depths of his own soul.
