	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: purple; font-weight: bold;">	
		Maanav's heart skipped a beat as his eyes fell upon the figure before him.
		His mind raced through faded memories until clarity struck—this was none other than Paramaansh Pratap,
		his father’s closest friend and one of the most revered magicians of all time.
		Overwhelmed, Maanav darted toward him and knelt at his feet, his voice trembling with emotion, “Guruji, you are here…”
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: red; font-weight: bold;">
		Paramaansh's gaze softened as he looked down at the boy.
		A flicker of recognition lit his eyes as he gently lifted Maanav to his feet.
		“Maanav! The son of my dear friend, Prajapati Prem.
		How you’ve grown… yet, why do I sense such sadness in you?”
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: navy; font-weight: bold;">
		Before Maanav could respond, Paramaansh pulled him into a warm embrace.
		For a moment, all the ridicule and despair that had clouded Maanav’s spirit seemed to dissolve.
		The old magician placed his hands on the boy’s shoulders, his voice filled with concern.
		“Tell me, child, how is your father?
		And why do you appear burdened, as if the weight of the world rests on your young shoulders?”
	</p>
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: transparent; font-weight: bold;">
		<mark>
				Maanav, holding back tears, poured out his story—his decline from a prodigious talent to a struggling,
				mocked student at the Sumeru School of Magics.
				He recounted the jeers of his classmates, the disappointment of his teachers,
				and the looming threat of expulsion if he failed the upcoming Inner School Competition.
				Paramaansh listened intently, his piercing eyes filled with both sorrow and determination.

	</p>
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: green; font-weight: bold;">
		“And your father?” Paramaansh asked gently. “How is he?”
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: coral; font-weight: bold;">
		Maanav’s voice faltered. “My father… he has been unwell for months.
		My brothers and sisters are by his side, taking care of him.
		I wanted to stay as well, but he insisted that I return to school and give this competition my best.
		He said…” Maanav’s voice broke,
		“he said I must not give up on my dream of becoming a great magician, no matter how difficult things become.”
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #802658; font-weight: bold;">
		Paramaansh nodded solemnly.
		“Your father is wise, as he always was. But tell me, Maanav, do you believe in your own magic?
		Do you believe you can overcome this trial?”
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #254117; font-weight: bold;">
		Maanav hesitated, his confidence shattered by years of failure. “I... I don’t know anymore.
		I fear that no matter how hard I try, I’ll never regain the magic I once had.”
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #151B54; font-weight: bold;">
		Paramaansh smiled—a mysterious, knowing smile. “Magic is not merely in the wand or the incantation, my boy.
		It is in the heart, the soul, and the belief that you are capable of greatness.
		Let the world doubt you if it must, but never doubt yourself.”
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #FFA729; font-weight: bold;">
		He handed Maanav a small, ancient-looking amulet.
		“This belonged to your father when he was your age.
		It guided him through his darkest moments and will now guide you.
		But remember, Maanav, it is not this amulet that holds the power—it is you.
		The strength you need has always been within you.”
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #1379FF; font-weight: bold;">
		Maanav clutched the amulet tightly, feeling a spark of hope ignite within him.
		Paramaansh’s words echoed in his mind as he resolved to face the challenges ahead.
		The path would not be easy, and the stakes were unimaginably high,
		but something deep within told him that this was his moment to rise.
	</p>
	
	<p style="background-color: #98AFC7; color: #805160; font-weight: bold;">
		And so, with newfound determination, Maanav prepared himself for the battle that would decide his future.
		The Inner School Competition loomed on the horizon, and with it,
		the chance to reclaim not only his place in the school but also his belief in himself.
		What secrets did the amulet hold? And would Maanav’s dormant magic awaken in time?
